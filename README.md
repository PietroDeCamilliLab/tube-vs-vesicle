# tube-vs-vesicle
To detect and analyze vesicle and tubing, we developed a programming tool based on a modified thresholding method, which allows for automated detection and quantification of tubing formation. 
In the subsequent detection module, vesicles and tube-like structures were detected by setting the intensity thresholds. Starting from input images, the vesicles were extracted by setting the threshold 1. The tube image was obtained from a subtraction of vesicle and set for threshold 2. Both vesicle and tube images were converted to binary images. Further correction steps for the tube images were required, first, bridge the thin gap between the two walls of the tube; second, remove pixels from the boundary of vesicles. We enhanced the image processing with noise reduction using dilation and erosion. We demonstrate the ability of the program to distinguish vesicles and tubes in close agreement with manual identification. We quantified parameters like the area covered by vesicles, the area covered by tubing, the ratio of vesicles to tubes, the number of vesicles, and the average tubing length. 
Image processing and Data analyses were performed by use of MATLAB.
